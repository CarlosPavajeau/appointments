# AGENTS.md - Wappiz Development Guide

This document provides essential information for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Communication

- Be extremely concise; sacrifice grammar for brevity
- At the end of each plan, list unresolved questions (if any)

## Code Quality Standards

- Make minimal, surgical changes
- **Never compromise type safety**: No `any`, no `!` (non-null assertion), no `as Type`
- **Make illegal states unrepresentable**: Model domain with ADTs/discriminated unions; parse inputs at boundaries into typed structures
- Leave the codebase better than you found it

### Entropy

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut you take becomes
someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt
that slows the whole team down.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this
project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners
you cut will be cut again.

**Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.**

## Project Overview

Wappiz is an open-source appointment scheduling platform. This repository containing:

- **Go backend** (root): Services, APIs, and shared libraries

## Code Style Guidelines

### Go Conventions

**Testing** - Use `testify/require` for assertions:

```go
func TestFeature(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("scenario", func(t *testing.T) {
        require.NoError(t, err)
        require.Equal(t, expected, actual)
    })
}
```

## Detailed Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Design philosophy (safety > performance > DX), zero technical debt policy, assertions, error handling with `fault`, scope minimization, failure handling (circuit breakers, retry with backoff, idempotency)
- **Documentation**: Document the "why" not the "what", use prose over bullets, match depth to complexity, verify behavior before documenting
